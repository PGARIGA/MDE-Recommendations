Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Recommendation

MDE provides security recommendations based on threat intelligence and best practices. One of the security hardening recommendations includes configuring UAC to automatically deny elevation requests to reduce the risk of privilege escalation.
GPO Method (Recommended)

Use Group Policy (GPO) to enforce this setting across multiple systems.

    Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).
    Navigate to:

Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → Security Options

Locate "User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users".
Set it to "Automatically deny elevation requests".
Click Apply and OK.
Close the Group Policy Editor.
Apply the policy by running:

    gpupdate /force

Registry Method (Alternative)

You can enforce the same setting via the Windows Registry.

    Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
    Navigate to:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System

    Find the key ConsentPromptBehaviorUser.
    Set its value to 0 (Automatically deny elevation requests).
    Close Registry Editor.
    Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.

PowerShell Script (Automation)

For automation, run the following PowerShell command:

Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "ConsentPromptBehaviorUser" -Value 0

Intune / Endpoint Manager (For Cloud-Managed Devices)
